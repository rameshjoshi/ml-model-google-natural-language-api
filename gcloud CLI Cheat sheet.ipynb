    "\r\n",
    "Finding gcloud CLI commands\r\n",
    "The gcloud CLI is a tree; non-leaf nodes are command groups and leaf nodes are commands. (Also, tab completion works for commands and resources!)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Most gcloud commands follow the following format:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "gcloud + release level (optional) + component + entity + operation + positional args + flags\r\n",
    "For example: gcloud + compute + instances + create + example-instance-1 + --zone=us-central1-a\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Release level\r\n",
    "Release Level refers to the command’s release status.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example: alpha for alpha commands, beta for beta commands, no release level needed for GA commands.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Component\r\n",
    "Component refers to the different Google Cloud services.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example: compute for Compute Engine, app for App Engine, etc.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Entity\r\n",
    "Entity refers to the plural form of an element or collection of elements under a component.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example: disks, firewalls, images, instances, regions, zones for compute\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Operation\r\n",
    "Operation refers to the imperative verb form of the operation to be performed on the entity.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example: Common operations are describe, list, create/update, delete/clear, import, export, copy, remove, add, reset, restart, restore, run, and deploy.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Positional args\r\n",
    "Positional args refer to the required, order-specific arguments needed to execute the command.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example: <INSTANCE_NAMES> is the required positional argument for gcloud compute instances create.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Flags\r\n",
    "Flags refer to the additional arguments, --flag-name(=value), passed in to the command after positional args.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example: --machine-type=<MACHINE_TYPE> and --preemptible are optional flags for gcloud compute instances create."
